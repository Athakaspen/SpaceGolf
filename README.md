This is the source code to a Fall 2022 Game Jam project called GalactiGolf. I designed and created it from start to finish in one week.

Download and play it here: https://athakaspen.itch.io/galactigolf

The game features networked multiplayer using a dedicated server instance. One server can run multiple independent lobbies and games simultaneously.

This was a single week, solo project, so there are relatively few comments. Sorry.

- Networking code is in the Scripts/MyNetworking/ folder. NetworkManager.gd has connection initialization information.
- Player synchronization is handled in Ball.gd
